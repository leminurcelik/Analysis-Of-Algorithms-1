# Analysis of Algorithms 1
In this Analysis of Algorithms 1 course, 3 assignments were done. In the first assignment quicksort algorithms was used to sort the dataset with specific values. In the second assignment heap functions were used to calculate 7 statistics functions as mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, first quartile and third quartile. In the third assignment red black tree functions were used to implement Completely Fair Scheduler(CFS).
